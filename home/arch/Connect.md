Connect auth vision
- open model (tim: preferred)
  - event driven vs explicitly driven
  - any employee of owner co can use connect no problem
  - it person is notified by event, asked to take action
    - provisional access
    - approve or deny future usage
    - list of users (oop, someone left, deny access)
  - basically, auto add of new users, x-acct
- closed model
  - only people on acct can use my connect
- usage tracking for IT user
  - which rooms get a lot of use?
- open model without code access (require bluetooth proximity?)
- time-based auth?
- room booking

- possibly a device access add-on
  - "I want to use industry's devices" add-on sub

- device settings

- device authentication
  - to listen to pubsub nodes
  - to prevent malicious registration w/meeting router?
  - etc
  - TPM module on nucs? (trusted platform manager)
    - securely store crypto keys
