- EVO3 notes
  - coworking space is a conduit to other ventures
    - maybe a tech accelerator? overrated
    - realtors found co-work, helps sell homes
  - wifi, discount code, pick 'day pass'

  - coding school, shared curriculum with other coworking spaces
  - taught 2 already
  - codebeetle school of technology
    - for these classes, typically 70-80% of revenue pays for curriculum
    - how to make learning
    - new curriculum, more collaborative less lecture
    - code-first, make it broadcast compatible
    - 5-10 minutes, then feedback, move on
    - never been done in a community like this!
    - target small-med curriculum, how to get an instructor to remote mtn places
    - impossible to get an instructor,=
    - abrams, turn key product to get a coworking space online
      - proximity (product name?)
      - add video conferencing to the tech stack provided by coworking space
      - door control, access control, wifi, etc
    - network to show who's online, connecting the people within coworking space
      -
    - all coworking spaces must have Foxden
      - need quality and experience as high as possible
      - one connect per space
    - charge students toparticipate in class
      - coworking space is given a rebate per student for hosting
      - but also puts them on the map,
      - incentivizing them to market, get people in
      - at 5 spaces interested, haven't asked for commitment yet
      -
    - another space right across the street, Elevate
    - steno, in Denver
  - foundation
    - huge poor population
    - really crush it in the coding classes
    - business campaigh but wiht an extra box
      - traditional marketing doesn't work
      - involvement in the community does work
    - giving back, filling a need, also drives business
    - members volunteer for the foundation
      - helps with being an entrepreneur or a startup
      - seeing kids that qualify for free lunch, helping them change their life

  - must be as EASY as possible
    - don't have any employees
    - let people self serve to get into foxden

  - evo3workspace.com
    - add a box and a picture to main page FOR Foxden

  - aside -
    - conference room mounting, bracket/mount

  - for pricing
    - too many choices means less propensity to buy

  - make foxden an exit barrier!
    - super easy, super good experience
    - _polished_

  - The coworking space portal they can upgrade/downgrade/pay
    - how do we hook foxden into that experience seamlessly

  - Pricing
    - shared workspace will pick up the tab for the unit
    - all members can use it
    - don't nickel and dime members
    - referral model*

  - 5ish devices

  - *** 4 icons in meeting, No hover! Not that intuitive
